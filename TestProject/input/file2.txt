Hadoop Map/Reduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process
vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of
nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.
A Map/Reduce job usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are
processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel manner. The framework sorts the outputs
of the maps, which are then input to the reduce tasks. Typically both the input and the output
of the job are stored in a file-system. The framework takes care of scheduling tasks,
monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.
Typically the compute nodes and the storage nodes are the same, that is, the Map/Reduce
framework and the Distributed FileSystem are running on the same set of nodes. This
configuration allows the framework to effectively schedule tasks on the nodes where data is
already present, resulting in very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.
